I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly‰ÛÓTommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?

You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me
You still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself
I don't want it even though I do

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
‰Û÷Cause it's not me
And what's the point in hiding
Everybody knows that we got unfinished business
And I regret it if I didn't say this isn't what it could be

You could break my heart in two

I know it's forward but it's true

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it

[Maestro]
Who be the brother with the harder rap, sippin' coniac
You catch a heart attack, rest your cardiac
I'm takin' over the game, like black quaterbacks
And guaranteed to put Toronto on the party map
Mr. Maes' in the flash, out to make a splash
Take Tyra to the bank, make Stacey wanna dash
Seen the gate open, I'll be there went it closes
Black Moses, slashing guns from the roses
Misdemeanor, blown up like Hiroshima
I love hip-hop like Scarface loved Gina
You're appluading this, astrologist
Words flex like a nidlest
I'm writin' words like a Novelist
Paragraph's gonna bury ya
Make the dance floor move like Jamiriquai
Get out the area
Take another blast of this nastiness, you blasphamis
Adversaries, they master this
Stylin', I'm a splash you, when I crash through
(Maestro's on the radio) 
Crash crew knows I'm funky
Female rappers wanna hump me
Salt jumped me, I made Pepa wanna bungee
Knowing that my jams legit, banking chips
Fort Langdon chicks, love to see me in spankin' whips
Proper, I was the one who told Mase
Save Mariah with the chopper, certified Cheif Rocka

[Chorus: Maestro, LaToya & Miranda]
416 to the 905
Put your hands up in the air, move 'em side to side
(We don't stop y'all, can't stop y'all, ah T-dot y'all, we make it hot y'all) 
And everybody in the place from east to west
Put your hands up in the air, move 'em right to left
(We gonna rock y'all, to the top y'all, you gotta..) 
Come on, come on

[Maestro]
Yo yo yo
I put the afro in the desiac, you're feelin' that
Fans say ""Wes, yo, where's the CD at? ""
Makin' sure the deal's phat
Suckers try to flex, breakin' necks
Leave 'em bleedin' like a hemophyliac
Peep the way the Wes mingle, Toronto s*x symbol
Honey jingle, dancin' to the next single
They be lovin' when I'm jammin' 'em
Wham bam, thank you ma'am
Knock 'em out, Rocky 3, Club Rolagin' 'em
Bringin' mass to the media, thedia
Rhymes iller than boulemia, laced with luekemia
Causin' pandemonium
Mad Sedonians know, I'm showin 'em
How to rock the auditorium
Vocally, I get high like Method Man and Reggie Noble be
Poetry, laced with my potency
Deadly with the loose leaf, 2-Rude produced beats
I chill out, ease back, like Kool Kieth

[Chorus]

[LaToya & Miranda]
Come on and do it
Do it
Yeah, come on, right
Come on and do it
What you wanna do? 
Unh, what you gonna do? 
Come on and do it
What you gonna do? 
Maestro, what you gonna do? 

[Maestro]
I got all these beats and a rhyme's attatched
Formin' a creation you just can't match
2-Rude got the rythym, and I rock mics
We takin' airpline flights, at huge heights
We make it hot like a suana
More dope than m********a
Metaphors got kick like Maradona
Like King Solomon, when I start polyin'
The whole metropolitan will start followin'
(the mad flavor kicker) 
Script flipper, rockin' on the higher set
Watch how hot the fire get
I score wit' crazy chicks
Get 'em open like a Martin Scorcese flick
Then I split to another spot (where?) 
T to the dot, O to the 'nother dot
Know who makes the party hot

[Chorus]"

Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get in Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in them shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm dripping in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from making tuna sandwiches to making the news
I started speaking my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're motherfucking right
Never been no fraud in my motherfucking life
Get money, go hard, damn fucking right
Stunt on these bitches out of motherfucking spite
Ain't no running up on me, went from nothing to glory
I ain't telling ya to do it, I'm just telling my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from way too lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smiling in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climb to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just trying to chill and make bangers""
Tell all these old bitches they in danger
The thing on my hip whip bitches in to shape
That's what I call a fucking waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what?
I think ya got your story screwed up
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough
I'm the one that's killing shit, hands down
If you got a problem with me, say it now
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissing
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on the go like I don't see no stop lights
I'm stepping out every day, prom night
So if it's all love, show me love then
'Cause you hating on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie low, that's how I'm pulling up
Just 'cause I been on the road, don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun
And we all know you ain't that tight
I smack you and the bitch that you act like
I started getting money, bitches upset
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced
Come through shinning with them Rollies bust face
Headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since 08'
I don't trust no nigga, I don't feel no bitch
Whole life been through some fucked up shit
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this
I walked into the label, ""where the check at?""
Cardi B on the charts, you can expect that
Where that bitch that was claiming she a threat?
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say, I'm too ratchet

It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest

Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it

Which off the shelf she took

Tonight without a reason
Except for feeling in the mood
For a little journey backward
To give her weary soul some food

Some memories prick her like thorns
Some really make her smile
But she can't stop holding that flower
That speaks of a life that once was hers

Out of reach, out of touch
But right now back in sight
She wishes she knew how to get back there

With her eyes closed she lets her
Memories take her on a ride
She relives all she has been through
And all she's put aside

It seems she had been walking
Down a long and rocky road
Sometimes she has been mourning
Her head she never bowed

Out of reach, out of touch

Out of reach, out of touch

She misses him badly, and still she cares..."

Hearts, without any hate
Crying for change
Causing a chain reaction


Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound

Yeah, when the music is playing and the place is jumping
When the bass rattles your ribcage, hey something's changed
I'm dancing face to face with a stranger
A moment of grace, you know that you're safe, and they just
Drop the beat the moment you most needed it
You came in as a question until the music completed it
Me and you in the universe, moving in unison, coming in hot
But in the grand scheme what do we got?
What we got is love even when the sinners hate us
We can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us
We sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side
We cut through the divide and we do it with pride
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change
Cause change is what they've been afraid of
Their malevolence can wait, raise the level of debate
Celebrate, elevate, love, love
(Love make the world go round)


Cannot be killed or swept aside
(Love make the world go round)
And fill the world with music, love and pride
(Love make the world go round
Love make the world go round)
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love

Your marriage made it is worth millions
Lemonade is a popular drink and it still is
Survival of the littest
Niggas who really up versus nigga up in your business
I'm in the room where real niggas not allowed
I'm the only one in the room that they fear right now
I think they're clear right now
Let's celebrate, no red champagne, we don't play that
All we see is gold bottles and paper plane hats
Twenty one Grammy's that I use for D'usse cups
I'm on the penthouse floor, call your way up
The OG's say, ""HOV, how high is high enough?""
I said ""'till we eye and eye with the higher ups""
Until we let 'em know, we ain't those niggas
Until our baby's showered in gold nigga
Blue looking like Pac in the tub
David LaChapelle levels of not giving a fuck
Prince left his masters where they safe and sound
We never gonna let the elevator take him down

I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

This wasn't me this was God's doing
And this time I won't finger roll, Pat Ewing
They ain't wanna see the Squad and the Roc
Now they chasing the Wraith like mister Softy's on the block
Stars on the roof got her feeling like Venus
Getting so much brain, now I'm a Don CartaGenius
Ever since Pun been gone been independent
So I went and threw the Pun Jumpman up in the pendant
I flooded out all the crises
Out in Paris I learned what real ice is
I'm kicking flavor in your ear
I just had a gray on my face and it disappeared
I just dropped the biggest of checks, and the shit cleared
When everybody counted us out just this year
Uh, I'm Steph Curry in the clutch
Take a shot of this Royal Elite and go all the way up

I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

My swag, my flow, I stole it back
They mad, too bad, my shows is packed
My town, my crown, I really rap
I'm home, my throne, I spoil you [?]
When the bitch was gone, they was really playing with it
I was sitting listening, like, they ain't even saying shit
Now the real is back, I see they all tryna change and shit
But it's really too late now, I'm going back yo
One of these bitches, two of these bitches gotta die
Three of these bitches, four of these bitches gonna cry
Five of these bitches popping pills, they high
Six bird bitches, none of them get fly
See, I don't wanna hear about your records and big numbers
Cause I was up top seven winters and six summers, cuffed
All in that bus, locked me all the way down
Now I'm all the way up

I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's
Got bottles, got weed, got molly
I'm all the way up
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need"

That after this fever, I'll survive
I know I'm actin' a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all

Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screamin'
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine, a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down
Down, down, down

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boy, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what!

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending, what we ain't

When we're the same

Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?

Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on

I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh, how do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love could be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones and we the oddest
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had

Make up

Look don't worry about it
Keep speaking Spanish I'll get it translated You know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy
Y por ti
Vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque ê©l te haga feliz
A mi
Nada me intimida pero entiendo
Que ê©l gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdê_"

Deja que ocurra, caliente que el tiempo transcurra
El ambiente la pone ardiente
Se pega y en el oido me susurra
Abusa y me engatuza, la falda mas cara combina con la blusa
Se mete en mi mente como una intrusa
Yo le digo que lo haga y no se rehusa
Dame mas
Yo te llevo en la nave si tu te vas
Y quiza sme digas que quieras mas
Yo quiero saber lo que tu das

I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel

Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
I ain't a player, I just crush a lot (crush a lot)
I ain't a player (I just play her, I just play her)

You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away

If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it (hey)
You got my heart, don't know how you did it (hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me (hey)

When you put your lips on mine
And, honey, it ain't a question (q-question)
'Cause, boy, I know just what you like

Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me

Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it)
The way I love you

Uh, I make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feeling lonely,
So you're sleeping in mine.
Come and watch a movie with me,
""American Beauty"" or ""Bruce Almighty"" that's groovy,
Just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you,
I'm not gonna get bored of
But, baby, you're an adventure
So please let me come explore you
So let me come and explore you

So don't you worry, baby, you got me

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you
I'm never good enough

When I don't care I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When ya come around I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help

It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you, make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
And there's no one else to blame
So scared I take off and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

I think I'd have a heart attack (Heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack - tack
Oh, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack"

This street is what scoot em and made em slicker, to slick with the ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot, but I'm still undefeated like shula

I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with alll my peeps
Baby, we can travel the world and not given view, and all you can see

There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break

'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile away, some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

Yea! Tengo diecisiete y enculo tu experiencia, 
si la operaciê_n de urgencia, el juez que juzga y sentencia, 
Ôçte duele! que este nota imberbe te eclipse
Mêçrtir de mierda, me la pela que tu vida sea tan triste
lo siento, no tenemos nada en comê_n
me enganchê© a gran hermano para ver sufrir a Dj Kun
soy un niê±ato y pa'mi que fumo demasiao'
pero tengo mas lê©xico que tu y no soy un licenciao, flipao
que me la suda tu LP, Mc's como cromos de cada 10, 7 son repes
apuê±êçlame, vuelve como Jason X, eres un friki
estoy en el keli fumando paki
Cariê±o, tu coê±o sonrê_e cuando le guiê±o
soy bueno y empecê© desde niê±o como Juninho
pilla cacho, doy hachazos como Corbacho
no bebo pero no se como siempre acabo borracho. 
Soy el francotirador de Washington y abarco fama y putas
cosmonautas anti sexo pierden no hay quien lo discuta
traigo la mierda mas bruta, pienso en mi futuro
y a diferencia de tu grupo mas que duro, soy maduro. 
La ira se apodera de mi angustia sueno muy bestia
modestia aparte a toda ostia. 
Bebe la chupa tu muletilla ya es bastante floja
Alojas, si me das otra hoja te dejo moja'

[Estribillo]
No es cuestiê_n de edades, crecimos con rap desde crê_os. 
No es cuestiê_n de edades, la experiencia se te a subê_o. 
No es cuestiê_n de edades, chavales nunca se sabe

[Porta]
Es simplemente simple, no queremos complicêçrtelo
aunque la vida es difê_cil no morirê© sin contêçrtelo
que no es cuestiê_n de edad ser un crack en el rap
yo con diecisiete y ya me follo a mas de la mitad
atentos todos, suena Porta, Mizok y Jota C
estilo, flow o tablas, calitê©, vamos compêçrate
el rap no va por edades abuela haber si te enteras
que esto es amor por el rap y en el amor ya no hay fronteras. 
No es cuestiê_n de edades solo en las mejores salas
y es que sabes que me encanta subir y cortar las alas
de los que vuelan sin rumbo
y aquê_ llegê_ el Mc que al gigante mas grande de este mundo tumbê_
a base de combos, yo, deje de ser aquel niê±ato
novato, no soy bacilo hasta que me den un buen trato
apunto al blanco, disparo, doy donde me interesa dar
porque repito que este mc no esta acostumbrado a fallar. 
Hay que currêçrselo dê_a a dê_a y es que la edad poco importa
escucha, calla, observa, aprende ponle ganas, rap a Porta
compite con peê±a buena gente que te meta caê±a
porque miles son Mc's solo hay 10 buenos en Espaê±a
se que esto darêç que hablar y si no, en foros se lo inventan
no existen comentarios tontos si no, tontos que comentan
rêçpido, refê_giense, pues este huracêçn se aproxima
y quiere cortar con mas fuerza que el conocido Katrina

Representa a niê±atos de mierda
la vieja escuela me la pela, tela
hice campana con la peê±a
me da que tu tambiê©n porque no te calculo nulo, seguro, 
no te enseê±aron que la edad solo es un numero garrulo
sudo del orgullo rap
hace mêçs desde que esta en la movida
estas donde empezaste besaste
un pico por tu parte lo de criticarme
y aparte de eso tienes algo que contarme
respeto hay poco como pocos que valgan
solo dame un micrê_fono, veras quien se lo marca de verdad
que va, me da que no es cuestiê_n de edad
dar calidad, estêç en esta manera de rapear
me queda cacho de camino te lo digo
solo 18 tacos macho y me siento un niê±o
paso, volverme viejo ante un espejo de cristal
elijo ser un crê_o de mierda, Ôèy que? que me da igual. 

[Porta]
Y es que no es cuestiê_n de edades, quizêçs solo de matices, 
dependiendo asê_ de la forma de pensar que utilices
yo opino que nadie es mejor ni peor con la edad
solo es cuestiê_n de experiencia tambiê©n de tu facilidad
para aprender de tus errores y seguir avanzando
si crees que lo sabes todo, te quedaras estancado
y no subirêçs mas peldaê±os, y ahê_ acaba tu camino
sin embargo se que a mê_ me queda un largo recorrido.

OK, guess who got that mhm-mhm nani-nani
In the Mondrian, mhm-mhm, in Miami
Whiz Galliano, whip-whip the Armani
In the drip-drip, lick-lick like a Lolly
Or, left from Jamaica, going foreign couture
Jimmy Iovine, Tom Wali and Dior
Keep me and Chrissy in Christian Dior
But that was before, or, for you
My name Nicki, little daddy, and you?
You can do anything you put your mind to
Way you French kiss it, ""FranÍ_ais parlez vous""
Way you work your tongue, can I hire you?

You know you really wanna HEY
Wanna taste my (woohoo)
You know you wanna get a peek
Wanna see my (woohoo)
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are (woohoo)
Kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)

Spent the weekends sewing the pieces back on
Crayons and dolls pass me by
Walking gets too boring when you learn how to fly

Not the homecoming kind
Take the top off, and who knows what you might find
Won't confess all my sins
You can bet all trying, but you can't always win

'Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements just like a gypsy
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me

A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover and tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out, so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline, in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys, I just want to enjoy
By having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out, so it can breathe

SOS, she's in disguise

So I can see how badly this will hurt me
When you say goodbye

Keep it sweet
Keep it slow
Let the future pass
And don't let go
But tonight I could fall too soon
Under this beautiful moonlight

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep

And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me

See this heart
Won't settle down
Like a child running
Scared from a clown

I'm terrified of what you do
My stomach screams
Just when I look at you

Run far away
So I can breathe
Even though you're far from suffocating me
I can't set my hopes too high
'Cause every hello ends with a goodbye

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this's unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me

So now you see
Why I'm scared
I can't open up my heart without a care
But here I go
It's what I feel
And for the first time in my life I know it's real

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this's unravelling
Your love is where I'm falling

If this is love please don't break me
I'm giving up

Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
And you tell her baby no way

But she caught me on the counter
""It wasn't me""
Saw me banging on the sofa
""It wasn't me""
I even had her in the shower
""It wasn't me""
She even caught me on camera
""It wasn't me""
She saw the marks on my shoulder
""It wasn't me""
Heard the words that I told her
""It wasn't me""
Heard the screams getting louder
""It wasn't me""
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
she was about to see
Why should she believe me
when I told her it wasn't me

Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on
Da right prefix whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seein' is believin' so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying bout things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Your answer: go over there but if she pack a gun
You know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter
""It wasn't me""
Saw me banging on the sofa
""It wasn't me""
I even had her in the shower

Creeping with the girl next door

How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked

‘èQuÍ© Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empaÍ±aste con tu furia mÍ_ mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregabÍç
Como permiso para asÍ_ romperme el alma

‘èQuÍ© Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borrarÍ_n tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabarÍ_n con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importabÍç
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

MaÍ±ana que amanezca un dÍ_a nuevo en mi universo
MaÍ±ana no verÍ© tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
No escucharÍ© palabras de arrepentimiento
IgnorarÍ© sin pena tu remordimiento

MaÍ±ana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
MaÍ±ana ni siquiera habrÍç razones para odiarte
Yo borrarÍ© todos tus sueÍ±os de mis sueÍ±os
Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

‘èQuÍ© Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empaÍ±aste con tu furia mÍ_ mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregabÍç
Con un permiso para asÍ_ romperme el alma

‘èQuÍ© Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borrarÍ_n tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabarÍ_n con tus farsas
Se te olvidÍ_ que era el amor lo que importabÍç
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

Y confundistes tanto amor que te entregabÍç
Con un permiso para asÍ_ romperme el alma

‘èQuÍ© Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las barrarÍ_n tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas
Se te olvidÍ_ que era el amor lo que importabÍç
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa"

You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew, what I know today
Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there

Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When it comes to this

Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?

There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you looking back

Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself, ohh

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you
Since you've been away
Ooh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time

(Frankie Fresh)
Ladies and gentlemen
The most beautifulest girl in the world pageant
Brought to you by Frankie J, Chamilitary Mayne
(Frankie Fr-fr-fr-fresh)
Cmon, lets go, ay

My swaggers like a dagger, I want it, I can have her
I pop up and I grab her like abracadabra
Body picture perfect like shes shakin it for my camera
Chunk the duece to Frankie while he move in for the capture

Everybody knows when I step in the club
Girls see me and they wanna show me love
I got my chain on with my shades on
Rockin designer shoes and I sold a million

So many girls but theres one that caught my eye
Pretty lady so fine she blew my mind
Oh why, cause shes the one for me

I've been around the world
And seen so many girls
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl

She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And her body built just like a coke bottle
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, snap!
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, bring it back!
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl

I think she knows that Im tryin to get at her
I'ma go ahead and try to put in work
What's your name? What's your number? Can I hit you up?
If you diggin what I'm sayin let me know what's up

So baby let me know if I can take you home
I just wanna be somewhere where we're alone alone
Cause you're the one for me

I've been around the world
And seen so many girls
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl

She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And her body built just like a coke bottle
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, snap!
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, bring it back!
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl

Welcome to Miami
I've seen so many mammies
Overseas, the girls I've seen
But none compare to you, oh baby

I've been around the world and back
I've never seen a girl like that
Now its clear to me that
Youre that girl for me

She looked at me and then she said, ""Ever had breakfast in bed?""
Then I said, ""I'd rather have breakfast in Brazil instead""
Then she said, Stop playin, why you messin with my head?
Then I said, Im not playin, I got a jet and we can jet

Guess I had you tryin to find an energizer battery
Keep goin she knowin shell be sweatin losin calories
You could be the badest b-, I bet you couldnt handle me
Put money on the bed and I can prove it on my salary

She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And her body built just like a coke bottle
But none can compare
Cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, snap!
(Come on, come on, come on, come on baby)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, bring it back!
(Come on, come on, come on, youre so sexy)
But none can compare
Cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, snap!
(I love the way your body moves)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, bring it back!
(I love your sexy attitude)
But none can compare
Cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl

T-t-that girl

Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
ÔèCê_mo se llama? (sê_), bonita (sê_)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (sê_) and keep on (sê_)
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything's so unexpected
The way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
ÔèCê_mo se llama? (sê_), bonita (sê_)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (sê_) and keep on (sê_)
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Don't you see, baby? Asê_ es perfecto

Baby, I know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

Oh, boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan

My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dê_a
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dê_a

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
ÔèCê_mo se llama? (sê_), bonita (sê_)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise (sê_) and keep on (sê_)
Reading the signs of my body

Seê±orita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia

Mira, en Barranquilla se baila asê_, say it!
En Barranquilla se baila asê_

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates for Humpty Hump
We need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Boo-boop-so-boop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

Te desnudas angelada

I can't believe you a sleaze, you a slut, a hoe
Now you want to have a change of heart? Damn!

Who'd have thought that you would deceive me?
Love of my life, you're my queen like Evie
And you didn't even tell me you leaving
I had to hear about it on Escandalo TV

But why the hell you crushing him for, god damn now!

And do something he doesn't wanna do
Do I live my life with you as my wife?
Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream?

I gotta do this for me
'Cuz if I dont I'll probably regret it
But if I do I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

How do you cope when the one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothin' you can do about it?
How do you deal with the fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career?

I gotta take it though it's heart breakin'
It's somethin' that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live? How do I deal without you?

It's killing me to know that your heart's with me
But you're with him 'cuz I chose to be in this industry
Money, shows and hoes come along with luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it

But this is the life that I was given
So I have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime
Without you?

How do you cope when the one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothin' you can do about it?
How do you deal with the fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career?

I gotta take it though it's heart breakin'
It's somethin' that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live? How do I deal without you?

How do you deal when you can't be with the one you love
And the one that you love is with somebody else?
(I don't know, I don't know)
And what do you do when you know she don't love him
And she loves me but she just can't stand loving you far away
(I guess I'm gonna have to just)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want to have to live with it)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(No, no, no)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else loving you)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else loving you, I don't want nobody else loving me.)

How do you cope when the one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothin' you can do about it?
How do you deal with the fact that you had a chance

Obession

Its early in the morning
And my heart is really lonely
Just thinkin bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But its driving me so crazy
I don't know if its right
I'm tossin turning in my bed
Its 4 o'clock in the morning
And I still cant sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do. I think I'm in love, baby
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)

Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong)

Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Now I know you're not my lady I'm just tryin to make this right
I don't know what to do I'm going out of my mind

So baby if you let me could I getchu to say maybe we could ride together
We could do this all night
Now I don't care if u got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cause I know he can't love u right, quite like I can
Its 4 o'clock in the morning
And I still cant sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless at home

I don't know what to do, I think I'm in love
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong)

Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that

I love the way u freaky like that
Its an obsession
Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin less supreme

Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got alot of money, I love to spend it
And thats whats up and I dont care what people scream

You're my blessin when I'm stressin
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cuz my money know how I do, we go rendez-vous, mi corazon belongs to you

To many freaks that'll please me
I'm that playa you better believe
I'm payin' on cheese, but I guarantee
That I still got a freak everyday of the week
I love feeling when you dealing with someone
Pumping' them holes in your body all night long
My keep gets bigger when you giving me dome
And I get a little crazy when its time to bone
Ma I like that you think that I was one of a kind
And my ice made you think that love was blind
Separate the greats, from the weak freaks
I would never hate, I love all my freaks
But I never bone, never let a hoe know that I
Gotta a lot of dough, she ain't gotta know
Take her to the room, I don't need your voice
But I might need your mouth to provide the moist
Didn't think you had it right till i met your needs
And swallowed my seeds and now I see

Met girls, girls, nasty girls
Real bad girls, chasin' this platinum world
And around, behind me and my shit
They say they really wanna get me high
They wanna spend some time
With a thug and get freaky with it
In a hot tub thuggin' gettin' weeded with it

I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly like a dove, fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation

In a natural mood then I'm a natural dude

Rockin' Dolce Gabbana with hydro in the Cabana

Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

Bounce that ass till you can't no more
Make your ass touch the floor like your legs are broke
Take that big ol' booty girl and scrub the ground
You can do it up and down and round and round
As long as that pussy ain't stiff
Dance and make all the niggaz look at that shit
Like a stripper at a club in the ATL
Lil bitch tore it up and started raisin' hell

I remember Magic City before the freakness
Before the police went on all them weak shit
All them big hoes, get loose with it
All them skinny hoes, let Bruce Bruce hit it
Let a nigga fuck tonight
Damn right bitch, fuck my wife, you my slut for life
You know all I do is count that cash
I won't charge you as long as you bounce that ass

Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

Biaatch, biaatch, shake that monkey

I bet she can't wiggle like with a dick in her
Have a motor booty contest and pick a winner
When she runnin', you never see a hoe come in last
She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2: 14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans

It's been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party wanna get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

You don't have to be naked to dance like a stripper
Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south

You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty is that for me?
It's lookin' so fat, we at the party
Lets hit the bar and drink Tequila shots
Find a spot on the floor, lemme see it drop

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

Now put your ass on his dick
Let him know you the baddest lil' bitch
Put your hand on your clit
Ask him do he like that shit
The way you move your butt
All he wanna do is fuck
Outside him and you in the truck
Sex so good you can't do it enough

Now put your ass on his dick

I'll be right here when your world starts to fall
Young girl, it's all right
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly

When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems
No one ever wants or bothers to explain
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means

When there's no one else
Look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend
Just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength
That will guide your way
If you will learn to begin
To trust the voice within

Young girl, don't hide
You'll never change if you just run away
Young girl, just hold tight
And soon you're gonna see your brighter day
Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
When you're lost outside look inside to your soul

When there's no one else
Look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend
Just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength
That will guide your way
If you will learn to begin
To trust the voice within
Yeah...

Life is a journey
It can take you anywhere you choose to go
As long as you're learning
You'll find all you'll ever need to know
(BE STRONG)
You'll breake it
(HOLD ON)
You'll make it

Just don't go forsaking yourself
(No one can tell you what you can't do)
No one can stop you
You know that I'm talking to you
When there's no one else
Look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend

Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman
Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Making up a few false rumors or two

That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Shout out loud!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will

So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended by the message I'm bringing
Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore

I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
What do we do girls?
Shout Out Loud!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Check it - Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can either give us some head, sex a roar
If the girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the table's about to turn
I'll bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it
It's airight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

But you're just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
So you're just a little boy
All you'll do is annoy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things

This is for my girls...
This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard

You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made that much stronger

Well I thought I knew you, thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But, uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I'd realized your game

I heard you're going 'round playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I
(I'm a fighter)
I ain't gonna stop
(I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Thought I would forget
Thought I, I remember
Yes, I remember
I remember

Thought I would forget
I remember
Yes, I remember
I remember

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe.
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed.

I am beautiful no matter what they say.
Words can't bring me down.
I am beautiful in every single way.
Yes, words can't bring me down... Oh no.
So don't you bring me down today.

To all your friends you're delirious,
So consumed in all your doom.
Trying hard to fill the emptiness.
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone.
Is that the way it is?

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down... oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh, no
So don't you bring me down today...

No matter what we do
(no matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(no matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go
(and everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
(the sun will always, always shine)
And tomorrow we might wake on the other side

We are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no

I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby
Let's talk about this mess

Well, I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good, holdin' down my spot
And I'm good, rappin' the girls on the block
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

All my pride is all I have
Your pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needin' me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad

The path you chose to run alone
I know you independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
The time is of the essence, why spend it alone

Some nights I waited up for you
Promises you made about comin' through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settlin' down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you're angry come here, I'll prove it now, come here

Stop playin', you gamin'
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good, holdin' down my spot
And I'm good, rappin' the girls on the block
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
The time is of the essence, why spend it alone

People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely chill baby you know me you love me
I'm like your homey instead of beef and confomy
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce baby console me, come here

Ain't nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now
And nothin' will ever be the same, do just be on your way
Go head and do your thang now
And there's no more to explain to me, you know
I know you game I'm not feelin' what you do

So I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah

Showered you with all of my love

And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that u know I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history she's worth and deserves
More than this cold world has given me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all hopes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl, that

I don't care about nothing else my baby (Baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Oooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
Cuz all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)

Haha
This is going out to you, you and you and you

To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the ground
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and

I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times you will always...
always be my girl

I don't care about nothing else my my baby (Baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Oooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
Cuz all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)"""

Grind-grimey, the thick body and the big body
Wit lyrics and 'draulics hotter than the Majave
Sellin', brubble bellin', career felon
Escalade 3-braid beard wearin'

Fuck it, I thug for free and thug to eat
Niggas call me ""Home of Cake"" cause I love the cheese
Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me

Ladies, fellas, they won't stop playin'

Came through the door, seen it before
Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor
You ever felt good to the point you so sure that
All the attention in the club is yours

Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior
Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws
Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more
And your crew's all but know it's a horse

Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'

Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin
I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again

And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan

It's so intimate, we so into it
Such a tender thing but fuck I'm innocent
Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'
Laughin' 'cuz I'm ma kidnap you for the weekend

Playin' the couch like Caesar's, she feedin' me grapes

If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me
'Cuz it's on, it's on
Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed
It's on, it's on

Now mami, let's get serious 'cuz by the looks of it
It seems your sexuality is just a little curious
You got a friend, we could gather then split
If not, I got a girl for every girl I get

There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast
We hit the Swiss Hotel before you finish your glass
And you know you wanna be where the cake is at
Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat

Mami, your body like Mallory on Natural Born Killer
She like, they got money but ya'll are more realer
She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us
No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it 'till you bit us

Yes I did baby, yes I did

It's funny 'cause for a while I walked around with a smile
But deep inside I could hear voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know it's not for you? I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away 'cause I love you, I just tried to stay

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright

I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says, ""I'm gonna be alright""

Friends of mine say to me, they say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part, I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you? You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do, now I realize that I can't change you

I used to say, I couldn't do it but I did it

And that voice inside says, ""I'm gonna be alright""

Said, ""I wouldn't walk away"", somedays I want to stay
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
Never thought it would be true, me livin' without you
But now it's time for me to make that move, oh

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it

You can dry my tears

You know that I can't stay

You know it's true

Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a
Less-than-perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance


Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things
You shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart


Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you
But somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid


Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things

Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be


Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things

I would give my life for you. You mean the world to me. Baby, baby, baby, baby
Babe oh oh oh oh oh oh oh... you know I love you.(ah come on yeah, yeah) I wanna
be together
We can runaway.(its nb-ridaz) just me and you.(same clique, new title) just

You and me. Will you runaway with me.
The day that I wrote these words for you, I cried. I could've died that day. A happy
and
Complete man cause in the palm of my hands everything that I dream for more and
You know that I'm down for yours forever in life the reason that I made you my
Wife is because you seen me for me. the real me and love me unconditionally and
Even with the circumstances that I had you still gave me a chance and that's why
I
Live and breath for you and the kids and you give me more then this fame could
Ever give me. And now my life is satisfied and complete, visions are coming true

Yeah of me and you. Placing rings on each other finger saying I do. You stuck
With me through my thick and thin. To go back live life over again nah this is
My destiny it was worth the agony to get the ecstasy

We can runaway and spend some time.I'll always be the one right by your side. Tell

the
Whole world you belong to me. You are me everything. oh... I want
Runaway with you. do, do, do, ... (chorus)
I never ever met a shorty that was quite like you. And even though it was
Wrong I fell in love with you. Now we sit here not knowing really what to do.
But I'm sure that you know that I'll give the world to you. If I could runaway
With you, I even think twice. I promise girl I put it all on the line. I know
forever seems to be a long time. But that's what I'm seeing when I look
Into your eyes. And it don't matter what your friends might say. Cause I know
deep inside you feel the same way. You can tell me what you want. But I

Could read your mind. So quit lying to yourself. And put your hand in mine. I

Get excited every time you come close. And being right here with you is
What I love the most. So any time that you're feeling lonely inside, we can
Runaway together leave this world behind.
Waking up in the morning and you are still not there. Can't we runaway and
Escape somewhere. Missing your soft touch your lips next to mine, holding up
Your hands as you look in my eyes. What must have happened to love that we both felt
inside. Emotions were strong and the feeling was right. Now we don't speak
Anymore. You went your own way. If that's what love's about then I was mislead.
Go head and take your time. If that's what you need, my love for you
Is forever my heart for you bleeds. Things happen for a reason. So I ask
Myself. Should I be strong or wait or move on to someone else I know you
Still love me. I can feel it inside you always keep it real no games no lies if
You ever feeling lonely feel the need to get away
Call me up I'll be there together we will runaway, girl."

Que tu sabes que yo vivo por tu piel (Solo te pido, no me dejes de querer)
Que cuando estoy pensando en ti mira me siento muy feliz y me siento bien (Solo te pido, no me dejes de querer)
Ay, no me dejes (de querer).

(Solo te pido, no me dejes de querer)
Quiero estar contigo juntitos hasta el amanecer (Solo te pido, no me dejes de querer)
Y ahora pa' que lo gozes bien escuchelo con Teddy Mulet (Solo te pido, no me dejes de querer)
(Solo te pido, no me dejes de querer)
Solo te pido, no me dejes de querer
Ay, no me dejes
(Solo te pido)
No, no, no me dejes (de querer)."

(Feel the rhythm)

From the coast of Ipanema
To the Island of Capri
All the way to Kuala Lumpur
I will follow you wherever you may be

From the moment I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free
Have to hold you in my arms now
There can never be another for me

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine

All I need is
To look in your eyes
Viva la mê_sica!
Say you'll be mine

Can you feel the heat of passion
Can you taste our love's sweet wine
Join the dance and let it happen
Put tomorrow cares right out of your mind

As the music draws you closer
And you fall under my spell
I will catch you in my arms now
Where the night can take us no one can tell

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine

All I need is
To look in your eyes
Viva la mê_sica!
Say you'll be mine

Gotta have this feeling forever
Gotta live this moment together
Nothing else matters
Just you and the night

Follow on the wings of desire
Now the rhythm's taking you higher
No one can stop us from having it all
You are my heart, you are my soul

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music
You're heart will be mine

All I need is
The look in your eyes
Viva la mê_sica!
Say you'll be mine

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine

All I need is

I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
on my fingertips, have to say is even better
Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

To see if reindeer really know how to fly
